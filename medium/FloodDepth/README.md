Tactic:
1. To form a flooded spot, there are 3 elements needed: 2 peaks and 1 plane that's lower than the peaks.
2. A peak is a relative higher plane than those around it. (1, 6, 9)
3. Another plane that's equal or higher than the first peak will close the pool, so we will use the new plane as our new starting peak. (6)
4. The end of area will not always having a peak, so we have to record the deepest hole even if we're not encountering any matching peak for the starting peak. (7 & 8 which created by 9)<br />
